        "   - Add a TTS (Text-to-Speech) greeting in the ExoML flow",

        "   - Login to https://my.exotel.com/",
        "   - Go to Flows/ExoML section",
        "   - Check Flow ID: 1027293",

        "   - Verify audio plays correctly",
        "",
        "5. **Quick Fix - Add Debug TTS**:",
        "   - Add a simple TTS element that says:",
        "     \"Hello, you are connected to the voice assistant.\"",
